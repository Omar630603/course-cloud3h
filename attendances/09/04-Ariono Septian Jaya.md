Advantages of SaaS SaaS is expanding as an attractive cloud solution in many different areas, offering many benefits to both users and businesses over installed software:

Quick commissioning and provision of services to customers: instead of sending software packages and issuing licenses, the user simply has to go online to start operations.

The provider deals with maintenance, which is a relief to employees: above all, IT teams do not have to worry about software installations, licenses, updates, or maintenance, but can focus their resources on tasks that are equally important for the company.

Easy integration for new employees: no need to license or install software for new employees. Creating a new registration in the web tool is enough to integrate them, which is helpful as they can start their work immediately.

Use of services both stationary and mobile from different devices: software is no longer necessarily bound to a workstation. With the login data, users can also access the tools from mobile or other systems. This also makes the home office concept considerably easier.

Cloud architecture provides all users with the same security standards: local hardware and software problems are less likely to lead to data loss due to the decentralized storage of all data on a cloud server. Smaller companies enjoy the same security standards as larger companies.

New functions and updates are implemented and integrated much faster: since the software runs on the vendor’s side, they also have complete control over it. This ensures that you always use the latest version of the services.

User-oriented: companies do not pay flat-rate amounts, but instead pay per user. Software licenses were often too expensive in the past in terms of size, especially for smaller companies. With payment options per user, corporate spending can be managed efficiently.

Disadvantages and dangers of SaaS The disadvantages and possible dangers of SaaS are mostly small. The SaaS model is spreading rapidly, and competitive pressures are continuously improving data security and performance. However, it is still worth noting the concerns that are associated with SaaS:

Sharing your data with the provider: Even if the operator claims to offer the highest levels of secrecy and data security protected by contract – your confidential company data is not de facto in your possession, but is stored on the operator’s side. Data leaks, hacker attacks, and other incidents that jeopardize your confidentiality are generally beyond your control. Cloud service security remains uncontroversial. In Europe, the new basic data protection regulations could provide for regulated conditions, when applied to the respective provider.

Danger of service termination: If the SaaS provider goes bankrupt or is forced to discontinue their service for other reasons, it is impossible to continue using the services, and, theoretically, all data and documents could get lost. However, SaaS rarely switches off spontaneously, and the providers in question usually give users time to back up their records and documents on other data carriers or servers. In some cases, one service changes over to another, whereby data can often be transferred.

Requires a quick, consistent internet connection: SaaS works online, so a good internet connection is essential. Many operators offer online modes that allow you to work without the internet and synchronize the data as soon as you go online again. However, you need a constant connection to the internet for optimal use of SaaS. Problems in your network can lead to annoying load times in the web tools, which can cause economic damage.

Software cannot be used during downtime: Similarly, not all SaaS can be used if the provider needs to temporarily take their services off the network for maintenance work or service downtime, for example.

Required compatibility with operating systems and browsers: Web tools may work differently depending on which browser you use. There may also be compatibility problems with the operating system, especially if you are using macOS. Most SaaS vendors are currently optimizing their tools for Windows, since after all, problems with the browser selection are extremely rare.

Commissioning unfinished software: Since SaaS is not traditionally produced and sold, SaaS vendors may be tempted to provide their software at an early stage of development. This can happen before extensive beta tests have been carried out or important features have been implemented. Generally speaking, quality control is much more careless for SaaS products.
