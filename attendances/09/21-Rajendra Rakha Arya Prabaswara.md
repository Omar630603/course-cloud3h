# Platform as a Service(Paas)

Platform as a Service is a service for building and managing applications
modern in the digital ageâ€”on-premise or in the cloud. PaaS is a development platform and
standardized, shareable and scalable application deployment
elastic packaged as a service. PaaS delivers infrastructure and components
middleware that supports developers, IT administrators, and end users to
build, integrate, migrate, deploy and manage mobile and web applications.
PaaS is referred to as a Shared Service, where PaaS has the idea that each
applications require some unique technology and a business cannot
including yourself from rigid deployment scenarios for packages and applications
special. PaaS enables an organization to achieve the fastest time to reach its target market with the lowest cost of ownership and management.
To aid productivity, PaaS offers ready-to-use programming components that
support developers building new capabilities into their applications, including
innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence, chatbots, blockchain, Internet of Things.

# Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a service, is a cloud-based software service model in which a cloud provider develops and maintains cloud application software, provides automatic software updates, and makes software available to its customers over the internet with a pay-as-you-go service concept. So SaaS customers can lower the cost of developing a service and improve business solutions faster than maintaining their own systems and devices, and customers can predict the total cost of services with greater accuracy.

# Object Storage

Is a regional service and does not depend on a specific compute instance.
We can access data from anywhere within or outside the context of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure,
as long as you have internet connectivity and can access any of the Object Storage endpoints.
Object Storage supports private access of existing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources
on the VCN through the gateway service.
