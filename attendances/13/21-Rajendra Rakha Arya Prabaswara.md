# Serverless with Oracle Functions, Events and API Gateway

1. Oracle Function

Oracle Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that allows developers to create, run, and
scale applications without managing any infrastructure. Functions integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, platform services, and SaaS applications

* How it works
Push function image to registry => Configure function trigger => Code runs only when triggered => Pay for code execution time only

2. Oracle Events Service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Events Service tracks resource changes using
Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) compliant events. Developer
can respond to changes in real-time by triggering Functions code, writing to
Stream, or send alerts using Notifications.

3. OCI API Gateway

The API Gateway service allows you to create HTTP/S interfaces that are set up for the service
others, including Oracle Functions, Container Engine for Kubernetes, and Container
Registry. API Gateway also provides policy enforcement such as authentication and
speed limitation to HTTP/S endpoints.
