### Serverless with Oracle Functions, Events and API Gateway

## evolutin compute
Decreasing concern (and control) over infrastructure implementation

## Functions-as-a-service (FaaS)
Decreasing concern (and control) over infrastructure implementation

## Functions Programming Model
Short execution
Stateless
Triggered from user code or cloud events
Self contained
Scale automatically
Container-Native – packed in container
Inherit a rich ecosystem of container tools

## Oracle function 
Functions-as-a-Service
Oracle Cloud Integrated
Container Native
Secure
Open Source Engine

## Functions == Containers
Functions are packaged as
containers
Package and reuse open
source libraries as functions! 

## Use cases : Where can you use Events?
Developers: Build Serverless applications with
Functions & Events to process files/images
uploaded to an Object Storage Bucket.
• IT Operations: Receive PagerDuty, Slack,
Custom HTTPS and email notification when
mission-critical operations e.g. database
backups complete.
• Security Admins: Send events to OCI
Streaming for down stream analysis.
• Multi-Cloud: Develop applications across
clouds that support CNCF cloudevents format
for processing events.

## Key Benefits
Pre-defined Event Types for subscribing to
OCI Native Service resource changes
• Easy and intuitive set up of rules
• Easy action on rules via Functions,
Notifications & Streaming
• Based on CNCF open standard
• Secure – Integrated with OCI Security
• Free!
