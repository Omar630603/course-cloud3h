Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) use automation to ensure that new application code is always tested, secure, and ready to use so teams can deliver to production on time. CI is the process of testing and building software automatically after the new application code is integrated into a shared repository. While CD is the process of delivering applications made in the CI process to the production environment, which is entered through automated tests. Automated tests ensure that the application functions as expected when pushed into the production environment into the hands of real users.

Software is developed iteratively (iteratively) in small chunks based on frequent user feedback.
Tests are written during and implemented throughout the development process to ensure quality application code.
Security patches and bug fixes are quickly deployed through automation.
New application code is often integrated with the existing code base and tested to ensure the software is always ready for production.
