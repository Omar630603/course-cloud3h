## 8 Cloud Computing Meeting Summary

At this meeting the main discussion was Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Services. Object Storage is a technology that manages data as objects. All data is stored in one large repository which can be distributed across multiple physical storage devices without having to split into files or folders. Object Storage is a storage service that specifically stores objects such as: Mp3, Mp4, JPG, GIF and others.

## Object Storage Resources:

1.Buckets : logical container for storing objects
2.Objects : All data types, regardless of content type, are stored as objects
3.Namespace : as top-level container for all buckets and objects
4.Compartment: primary building block used to manage cloud resources

## Object Storage Characteristics :

1.Strong Consistency : When there is a read request, Object Storage will make the most recent copy of the data written to the system
2.Durability: regional service, data is stored redundantly across multiple storage servers
3.Custom Metadata : We can define our own extensive metadata as key-value pairs for any purpose
4.Security : Object Storage ensures the security of data stored using data encryption

## How to access Object Storage:

1.Console
2.CLI
3.REST API
4.OCI SDK

## Limits on Object Storage Resources :

Authentication and Authorization
Blocking Access to Object Storage Resources
Object Storage IP Addresses
The main advantage of Cloudian object storage is that users can group object storage devices into large storage sets and distribute those sets across multiple locations. This not only allows for unlimited expansion, but also increases robustness and high data availability.

## Benefits of Using Object Storage:

1.High level of reliability (Highly Reliable)
2.Save on CapEX and OpEX Costs
3.Protected Data
4.Protects data from hardware failures and bad sectors
5.Design and distribution made for high availability and durable
