<H1> What is object storage? </H1> <BR>
Object storage or object-based storage is a system for storing data <BR>
which uses a flat structure and breaks files into pieces that can be spread out among storage hardware. <BR>
  Data is broken into discrete units, known as objects, and given a unique identifier <BR>
  that lets the object be found in a distributed system, along with detailed metadata that describes data.<BR>
<H1> Benefits of object storage </H1> <BR>
Now that we've described what object storage is, what are its benefits?<BR>
•	Greater data analytics. Object storage is driven by metadata, and with this level of classification for every piece of data, the opportunity for analysis is far greater.
•	Infinite scalability. Keep adding data, forever. There's no limit.
•	Faster data retrieval. Due to the categorization structure of object storage, and the lack of folder hierarchy, you can retrieve your data much faster.
•	Reduction in cost. Due to the scale-out nature of object storage, it's less costly to store all your data.
•	Optimization of resources. Because object storage does not have a filing hierarchy, and the metadata is completely customizable, there are far fewer limitations than with file or block storage.
<H1> Object storage use cases </H1> <BR>
There are multiple use cases for object storage. For example, it can assist you in the following ways: <BR>
•	Deliver rich media. Define workflows by leveraging industry-leading solutions for managing unstructured data. Reduce your costs for globally distributed rich media.
•	Manage distributed content. Optimize the value of your data throughout its lifecycle and deliver competitive storage services.
•	Embrace the Internet of Things (IoT). Manage machine-to-machine data efficiently, support artificial intelligence and analytics, and compress the cost and time of the design process.
