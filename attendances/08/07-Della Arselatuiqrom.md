Summary Week 8 :

Object Storage:
-Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service is a high-performance and scalable storage platform, offering reliable and cost-effective data resilience. The Object Storage service can store an unlimited amount of unstructured data of any type of content, including analytics data and content (such as images and videos).

Object Storage Resource Bucket:
-Bucket is a logical container for storing objects. Users or systems create buckets as needed within a region.

-Compartment bucket with a single compartment that has policies to define what actions the user can perform on the bucket and on all objects in the bucket.

Object Storage Resource Object:
-All data types, regardless of content type, are stored as objects. An object consists of the object itself and metadata about that object. Each object is stored in a bucket.

Object Storage Resource Namespace:
-Namespace Object Storage serves as a top-level container for all buckets and objects. At the time of account creation, each Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenant is assigned a unique Object Storage namepase that is system generated and cannot be changed.

-Namespace includes all compartments within a region. We can control the bucket name, but the bucket name must be unique in the namespace. Even though the namespace is region-specific, the namespace name itself is the same across all regions.
