Benefits of object storage
Now that we've described what object storage is, what are its benefits?

Greater data analytics. Object storage is driven by metadata, and with this level of classification for every piece of data, the opportunity for analysis is far greater.
Infinite scalability. Keep adding data, forever. There's no limit.
Faster data retrieval. Due to the categorization structure of object storage, and the lack of folder hierarchy, you can retrieve your data much faster.
Reduction in cost. Due to the scale-out nature of object storage, it's less costly to store all your data.
Optimization of resources. Because object storage does not have a filing hierarchy, and the metadata is completely customizable, there are far fewer limitations than with file or block storage.
Object storage use cases
There are multiple use cases for object storage. For example, it can assist you in the following ways:

Deliver rich media. Define workflows by leveraging industry-leading solutions for managing unstructured data. Reduce your costs for globally distributed rich media.
Manage distributed content. Optimize the value of your data throughout its lifecycle and deliver competitive storage services.
Embrace the Internet of Things (IoT). Manage machine-to-machine data efficiently, support artificial intelligence and analytics, and compress the cost and time of the design process.
What is Amazon S3 Storage?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a storage system for the internet, where you can store and retrieve any amount of data, anytime, anywhere. This make web-scaling computing easier for developers, and it also gives them access to the infrastructure that Amazon uses to conduct a global network of websites. The Amazon S3 API offers a common path for rapid development and the creation of hybrid cloud deployments at scale.

NetApp and object storage
Store and manage unstructured data at scale by using NetApp® StorageGRID® for secure, durable object storage for the private and public cloud. Place content in the right location, at the right time, and on the right storage tier, optimizing workflows and reducing overall costs for globally distributed rich media.
