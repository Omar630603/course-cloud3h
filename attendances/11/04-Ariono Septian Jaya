## Docker Network Type

Bridge
Host
None

## Docker Network Bridge

The default network type from Docker.
When the Docker service daemon is running, it will configure a virtual bridge called docker0.
If you don't specify the network used, docker run –net= then the Docker daemon will connect to the container using a network bridge.

## Docker Network Host

Docker network of this type is to put the container in the stack hostnya network.
All predefined network interfaces can be accessed via containers.
When running the container use the –net=host parameter, so the container will use the network host.

## Docker Network None

Network None aims to not configure networking.
No drivers are used on this type of Network.
When you don't want the container to be accessible. The command used by adding the parameter –net=none.

## Networking Docker Command

The basic command is docker network then added some parameters after the basic command.
docker network ls; to find out the available networks on the docker host.
Docker network create; to create a network on the docker host.
Docker network rm; to delete the network contained in the docker host.
Docker network connect; to connect containers on a specific network.
Docker network disconnect; break the network on the container.
Docker network inspect; to know the details of a network.

## Expose and mapping ports

A common scenario is when you want a container to accept incoming connections, either from another container or from outside docker.
An application server listening on port 80 or a database that accepts incoming requests.
An image can also expose ports.

## Persistent Storage (Volume)

Persistent storage in docker aims to maintain the data in the container even though the container has been deleted
Persistence storage can also share data between other containers or with docker hosts.

## Docker Volume Command

Docker volume create; to create a volume
Docker volume inspect; displays detailed information on one or more volumes.
Docker volume ls; displays a list of volumes.
Docker volume rm; delete one or more volumes contained in the docker host.
Docker volume prune; delete all unused volumes, all volumes that are not used by the container will be deleted.

## Docker Volume Driver

Similar to networks that have drivers, volumes also have volume types to be able to integrate with other types of storage.
Docker volume driver for Azure file storage; a docker volume driver that Azure file storage uses to mount files shared in the cloud to a Docker container as a volume.

## Docker Compose

Docker compose is a tool for defining, launching, and managing services, where a service is defined as one or more of a docker container.
Services and system services are defined in YAML files and managed using the docker-compose command-line command.

## Docker Compose Basic Commands

Docker-compose up; create and run a container, when the –d parameter is added, the container will run as a daemon.
Docker-compose down; stop and delete all resources.
Docker-compose logs; see the logging on the container.
docker-compose ps; View running containers.
