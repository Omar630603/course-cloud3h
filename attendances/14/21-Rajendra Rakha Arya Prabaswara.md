## What is CI/CD Pipeline ?

- A CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery using either a DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.

- Secrets and Tokens are important in any CI/CD pipeline implementation tool. Can protect sensitive information, such as connection strings and passwords, and store passwords or other secrets applied in application configuration settings.

## How does CI/CD work ?

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** and Continuous Delivery (CD) use automation to ensure that new application code is always tested, secure, and ready to use so teams can deliver to production on time. CI is the process of testing and building software automatically after the new application code is integrated into a shared repository. 

- **Continous Delivery (CD)** is the process of delivering applications made in the CI process to the production environment, which is entered through automated tests. Automated tests ensure that the application functions as expected when pushed into the production environment into the hands of real users.

## Testing 

- Continuous Testing is a development practice, where developers need to continuously integrate the code into a shared repository during a dayâ€™s test plan. Automated builds are created that verify each test.
