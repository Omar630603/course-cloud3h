# Week 15

# High Availability on Cloud 

High availability has become one of the biggest challenges for providers, and many services can be used to improve service availability such as :

1. checkpointing
2. load balancing
3. redundancy

# Calculating Availability

Availability cannot be calculated, nor guaranteed. Availability can only be reported after, when the system is running for several years. Over the years, a lot of knowledge and experience was gained on how to design hight availability system.

# MTBF and MTTR

- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** Average time elapsed between failures.

- **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)** The time it takes to recover from failure

# Influencing factors Source of unavailability

1. Human errors

2. Software bugs

3. Planned maintenance

4. Physical defects

5. Environmental issues

8. Complexity of the infrastructure
