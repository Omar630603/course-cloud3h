# CI/CD

_Continuous Integration_ and _Continuous Deployment_ or commonly abbreviated CI/CD is an automation concept that helps programmers work to do the same thing without the need to run it manually.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Refers to continuous integration which automates a process for developers. Successfully executed ci means new code changes to applications that are regularly built, tested, and incorporated in the same repository.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

It is a process to automatically deploy applications in the production environment.

### CI/CD Illustration

1. CI Example 

   - Build

   - Test

   - Merge

2. CD Example

   - Automatically release to repository

   - Automatically Deploy To Production

### Github Actions

is a set of actions contained in the _workflow_ Github repository.

- **Action** : The smallest block in a workflow, can be identified as an individual task.

- **Artifacts** : Files that are generated during software development.

- **Event** : A workflow trigger found in Github Actions. Triggers can be set at the time of push code to Github or pull requests that have been made.

- **Job** : This is a defined step to execute an action.

- **Step** : A task that contains an action or command to run the job.

- **Workflow** : Processes set up in YAML files to define build, test, package, or deployment jobs.

- **Workflow Run** : A workflow that executes based on preconfigured triggers/events.
