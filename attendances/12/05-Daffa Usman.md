CI/CD Overview
In software development, multiple team members develop code and contribute to creating the software’s functionality. When multiple people contribute to a code base, it is important to maintain its integrity and ensure that any team member can retrieve the latest version and build and run it locally.
GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions are a set of actions in a GitHub repository workflow.
	Action: The smallest building block of a workflow is an action, which can be identified as an individual task.
	Artifacts: The files generated when you build your software project or test your software project are artifacts.
	Event: An event triggers a workflow in GitHub Actions. Once a code change is pushed, or a pull request is made, an event can be set up in GitHub Actions to trigger the workflow.
