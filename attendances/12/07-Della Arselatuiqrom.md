Summary of Week 12 :

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development

The "CI" in CI/CD always refers to continuous integration, which is an automation process for developers. Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository

The "CD" in CI/CD refers to continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment, which are related concepts that sometimes get used interchangeably.

In software development, multiple team members develop code and contribute to creating the softwareâ€™s functionality. When multiple people contribute to a code base, it is important to maintain its integrity and ensure that any team member can retrieve the latest version and build and run it locally.

Two important aspects should be maintained to assure the code base's stability. The first aspect is to ensure that the code is compiling without errors. The second aspect is to ensure that all unit tests validating code behavior pass, including the latest code changes, at a very high percentage.
